          <h2>The Father Of Nation</h2>
          <p>
            <b>2nd October is Gandhi Jayanti. A karma yogi who inspired freedom movement based on truth and non-violence. A venerable soul whose legacy continues to guide us on the path of righteousness and peace.

                The father of the nation- Gandhiji strove hard to free India. Gandhiji’s ideal of non-violent civil defiance has encouraged civil rights movements across the globe for decades. His legacy endures to this day as a source of encouragement for freedom-loving people universally. The great vision of social awareness, clean, neat and beautiful India was Bapu’s dream. The seeds of karma yoga by the great yogi might have sown a few decades ago, but the vision of Swachh Bharat and an independent nation continues to grow from strength to strength.
